Hi there 👋 My name is Molly!

🔭 I’m currently an IT student at Wintec in Hamilton, New Zealand, with a focus on Software Engineering.

🛠️ My tech toolbox includes Java, C#, Python, Godot, MySQL, .NET MAUI, Vue.js and more.

🌍 Originally from Wisconsin, USA, I've been enjoying the Kiwi life in New Zealand for the past 12 years.

🌿 I love to work the right side of my brain with crafts, games, and exploring nature.
