Hi there 👋 My name is Molly!
🔭 I’m currently an IT student at Wintec in Hamilton, New Zealand, with a focus on Software Engineering.

🌱 I’m diving into the world of C# and loving every bit of it.

💻 I'm curious about what it takes to become a full-stack developer, exploring both front-end and back-end technologies.

🛠️ My tech toolbox includes Java, C#, Python, MySQL, .NET MAUI, Vue.js, and Office 365.

🌍 Originally from Wisconsin, USA, I've been enjoying the Kiwi life in New Zealand for the past 12 years.

🌿 I love to work the right side of my brain with crafts, puzzles, and exploring nature.
